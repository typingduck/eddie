    Updates for Erlang R9B-1

Eddie-1.5.0 Changelog

date: 2000/10/1 author: geoff
    Updates for Erlang-5.0.1 (OTP R7B)

Eddie-1.4.2 Changelog

date: 2000/17/9 authors: geoff, clement, pekka.
    Slackness filling out this file.
    Basically some fixes to the lbdns so it can receive a binary format.
    Gateway now sends a binary - could be replaced by a C agent (for NT).
    Fixes to migration stuff.
    Improved C relays (non-blocking). 
    Some solaris packaging stuff.
    Script fixes.

date: 2000/2/10 author: geoff
    Totally rewritten startup mnesia database stuff because it
    was causing grief with 4.9.1.

date: 2000/2/02 author: rob
    Rewrote relays to make buffering simpler (and future changes
    easier). Also fixed an ugly little CGI problem.

date: 2000/1/21 author: pekka
    DNS fixes.

date: 1999/12/20 author: geoff
    Many fixes for Erlang 4.9.1

date: 1999/12/07 author: geoff
    Keep-alive fix for proxies wanting to do keep alive.

date: 1999/12/06 author: pekka
    Significant DNS patches. It now waits for all spawned children
    queries a domain to reply. This means parts of DNS records
    don't get lost (resulting in a problem that appeared to be
    a cache problem).

date: 1999/12/03 author: geoff
    Numerous gateway fixes/updates for the new OTP/Erlang release (erts-4.9.1).

date: 1999/11/11 author: pekka
    Dns overload fixes, poll_pending() removes all EXIT messagages, 
    even the ones from the parent. The process woud not die properly 
    when the parent dies, the EXIT could be gone in the slist_loop() then.
    Delay opening of the udp port until its really needed, i.e. when you
    send something, not at process startup.  Limit the usage of udp ports 
    through the new udp tracker module that limits the no of udp ports and 
    retries to get the udp later if limit is reached.

date: 1999/11/8 author: ttey;
    Another fix for partitioned network reconciliation.

date: 1999/11/2 author: ttey;
    A migration fix which ensures the relays go away (they weren't).

date: 1999/10/30 author: ttey;
    Fixed an infinite event loop type problem occurring in certain
    (rare) failure circumstances.

date: 1999/10/20 author: rob;
    Many improvements to keepalive handling.

date: 1999/10/15 author: rob;
    Many improvements to the way the relay handles buffering.
    Hopefully children won't kill themselves so often now.

date: 1999/10/04 author: rob;
    POST fix in relay engine

date: 1999/10/04 author: lawriea@eamail1.unisys.com;  
    Configuration patches for Slackware 3.6

date: 1999/09/20 author: geoff;  
    Fixed an ugly typo introduced in Eddie-1.2.0 which stuffed up
    IP migration. Eric (ttey) actually noticed the crash first.

date: 1999/09/** author: geoff;  
    Completely re-did the initiation sequence and script front-end
    to Eddie so its much easier to use.

date: 1999/09/** author: ttey;  
    Clean up lots of code and rewrote the inet_server stuff 
    to interface with an external proxy (written by Rob).

    Enjoyed deleting lots of crufty code :)

date: 1999/09/** author: rob;  
    Completely rewrote the inet_server proxy as a set of C processes:
      * this enables Eddie to handle many file descriptors
        (probably OS max).
      * massively improves Eddie's performance
      * problems logged to /var/log/messages

date: 1999/09/** author: pekka;  
    A number of minor bug fixes in the DNS.

date: 1999/08/02 05:14:38;  author: geoff;  
    Scripting changes for standalone load info server (eddie load directive).
    New app directory for shared code (lonelb).
    Modified Makefile.in to support this.
    Add new boot script in system.

date: 1999/07/29 05:33:20;  author: pekka;  
    Created standalone load information server module code,
    this allows the load information server to run independently of
    the gateway for minimal DNS only setups.

date: 1999/07/12 07:12:15;  author: tobbe;  
    Added new single configuration interface to OAM tree.
    Left to do:
     - get it compiling
     - Read from Mnesia and fill the datastructures
     - Store in Mnesia
     - Write/Read config files

date: 1999/06/29 00:12:48;  author: maurice;  
    Added error report to log file ... report not running as root
    Add check to C programs to check that the UID is appropriate

date: 1999/06/21 23:57:42;  author: jon;
    Changed the queue/reject/blocked responses to be of HTTP version 1.0
    instead of 1.1 (cannot answer with version 1.1 if client does not send
    1.1 requests).
    Added the header: Pragma: no-cache
    to the queue/blocked/reject and status pages. 
    These pages should not be cached.

date: 1999/06/15 17:33:36; author jon;
    I have updated the admission control module (and documentation) so now
    the maximum number of sessions is actually followed. I have tested the
    changes quickly and quite a few things seem to work, namely:
    - maximum number of sessions
    - maximum number in the queue
    - order of queueing people getting access (FIFO)
    - never & always admit IP's
    - queue/reject/blocked pages
    - session time

date: 1999/06/01 12:13:12; author geoff;
    Removed estart,estop, etc and created a single
    'eddie' script to drive Eddie. Various script fixes & updates.
    Makefile updates to separate installable components and use 
    install-sh.

date: 1999/05/17 00:47:35;  author: jon;  
    The request part of a job is no longer a binary, instead it is a list of
    lists. Since the request is checked in these modeles in case clauses,
    the request has to be flattened into one list (lists:flatten).

date: 1999/05/13 04:29:55;  author: jon;  
    Changed the load information displayed when using estatus. It now shows the
    Node_load as received from load_server:node_load
    Also fixed the erlet_*. So now estatus works from netscape as well 
    (good or not).

date: 1999/05/13 02:36:15;  author: ttey;  
    Merged NT port.

date: 1999/05/03 00:02:03;  author: mpr;  
    Documentation update in preparation for release. 

date: 1999/04/27 08:17:27;  author: geoff;  
    Changes to get log rotating via SIGHUP working.
    Wrap logs disabled.
    Seems to be running - log rotation not tested.
    start_httpd, stop_httpd now go into the bin directory.
    INSTALL_ROOT appears to work.

date: 1999/04/26 05:11:39;  author: jon;  
    Changed so that the header 'X-Forwarded-For: <Ip-Address>' is added to
    the HTTP requests if it is not already in the original request.

date: 1999/04/22 03:57:06;  author: jon;  
    Bugfixed the GC problem, with accept processes not disappearing.
    Also changed to remove crashed backends from clients db

date: 1999/04/22 06:56:23;  author: tobbe;  
    Created a new file queue_srv.erl containing the queue server
    which previously was located in inet_server.erl. Also started
    to move around some code in the inet_server.erl. No functional
    changes was made.

date: 1999/04/22 00:37:07;  author: maurice;  
    Removed Makefile/bash dependency

date: 1999/04/22 05:12:54;  author: dwyer;  
    master_server:status/0 now also reports on the ports being used.

date: 1999/04/20 03:53:56;  author: pekka;  
    dns_sig was started as a supervidor in dns_sup.erl, its not a supervisor
    and should be started as an worker.

date: 1999/04/19 01:05:48;  author: geoff;  
    Fixed ifdel problems (including an ugly hack suggested by Tobbe).

date: 1999/04/19 00:42:54;  author: maurice;

    The -c -d switches are now also required for eadd, edel and estatus.
    Re-arranged some of the code in inet_server.erl which dealt with
    status information gathering. No functionality has been changed,
    just some cosmetic improvements....

    Autoconf fixes for linux

date: 1999/04/12 00:34:11;  author: jon;  
    Badmatch in http_admit, found bad match in is_db:get_dequeued_size(Db)
    which returns the number directly and not [{_,Number}]

date: 1999/04/08 06:00:16;  author: geoff;

    Added database to remember which BE's a client has been proxied to, in
    order to send following similar requests to the same BE.
    Files changed to handle multiple requests and the "chunked"
    Transfer-Encoding. The syncronization of sending requests to backends 
      is changed (not tested).

          have footers.

date: 1999/04/01 00:42:14;  author: geoff;

    the top definitions in the top-makefile.

date: 1999/03/24 00:01:07;  author: jon;  
    Restructring done. Body of large requests can be read in parts and sent
    through to backend. The http module is split into 4 parts, http,
    http_admit, http_parse and http_proxy

date: 1999/03/10 02:32:14;  author: jon;  
    The sending of the request(s) to backends is changed since the body is
    read earlier than before ("has to" since there is no way of telling how
    large a chunked message is).
