TODO for ERFS-0.2b1

- Node supervision: Monitor nodes and perform actions when nodes come
back. Erfs is prepared for this but it's not implemented.

- Fault tolerance: The handling of unsuccessful operations is very
limited.

- Shell scripts: Construct shell scripts that performs all the actions

- Bat files: Construct bat files (or equivalent) to perform all the
actions in the windows environment.

- Testing, testing, testing... 

- Validate or verify (maybe both): Verify/validate that a Path or the
entire file system corresponds to what is in the database.

- Effective file transfer: Send files in chunks. Look into compression
methods. 

- Synchronize: Synchronize an entire ERFS. 

- GUI: Do we need a graphical user interface? 

- Automatic replication: Is it needed?

- Logging: Log all actions

- Remote code loading: Load the erfs code from a running erfs node
when you do add_node. This will remove the requirement of having erfs
installed on all nodes.

- Undo: Implement the functionality to undo changes. Not very likely
to be implemented.

- CODA: Check out CODA.
