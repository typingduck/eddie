Hmm - I've included this package in the Open Source distribution
because it has some interesting ideas. Personally I think
it should probably be a separate package (for example
a fully replicated file system type for Linux would rock!).

Anyway - it was originally written to be part of Eddie;
so here it is.

It is NOT functional.

Erlang (or Eddie) Replicated File System, ERFS-0.1 Beta

- What is ERFS?

Erlang (or Eddie) Replicated File System, ERFS, is a simple approach
towards a fully replicated multi-master file system. The general idea
is to work in the ordinary file system and when the need occurs to use
CVS-style metaphors to control single files or directories, possibly
containing other files or directories. The aim for ERFS is content
replication within a LAN. Erfs uses well tested functionality in
Erlang 4.7.3 (JAM) to guarantee robustness. Before we travel any
further down this road we need to know if this is a viable approach.


- Requirements

ERFS-0.1 Beta requires Erlang 4.7.3 (JAM) on UNIX and Erlang 4.7.3.1
on Windows. These can be found from http://www.erlang.org/

ERFS-0.1 Beta also requires some knowledge about the erlang and the
erlang shell.


- Current state

ERFS is in early beta state. Things will change. Much functionality is
missing (see the TODO file for more details on what might be
implemented in the near future).


- Feedback

Please send feedback to, anders@eddieware.org. We need to know if this
is something that can be of any use. Do we actually solve any
problems? What is missing? What needs to be changed?


- How it is done

ERFS is implemented in Erlang 4.7.3 (JAM) and has been tested on
Solaris, Linux and Windows 9x/NT. To run on Windows you need to use a
patched version of Erlang 4.7.3 (JAM) (patch erl_083_otp_win32.exe).
ERFS requires that Erlang 4.7.3 (JAM) and ERFS to run on each node
which should be a part of the replicated file system. Due to some
limitations in Mnesia, the database management system in Erlang 4.7.3
(JAM), some operations in ERFS requires that all nodes are up during
the operation. ERFS also requires that, whoever is running Erlang
4.7.3 (JAM) has read and write permission where the files and
directories will be stored.

ERFS is in a very early beta state and will continue to be so until we
know that is has some desired functionality and you'll find it
usable. The TODO file contains ideas that might be implemented.

Basically files and directories is kept in the ordinary file system
and journaling data about them is kept in Mnesia. ERFS will make sure
that all nodes has the right version of a file or directory on a user
driven base.


- How it works

You need to have ERFS running on each node that should be part of your
replicated file system. Look in the EXAMPLES on details about how to
run ERFS. After ERFS is running on at least one node, you're free to
start adding file systems to it. File systems in ERFS needs to have a
name. You need to defined where the physical root directory for your
replicated file system should be on each node. Once that is done use
functions in the erlang module erfs to control the file system. To
manipulate a file or directory, start by checking it out. Once you are
done use check in to replicate your changes to all other nodes.


- Functionality in ERFS-0.1 Beta

All functions are in the erfs module

- add_node(Node) 
Add a node (replica) to ERFS. The node should already be
started. Se EXAMPLES for details.

- delete_node(Node)
Delete a node (replica) from ERFS. The node will be deleted from the
database and stopped.

- init_erfs(Erfs, NodeDefs) 
Initialize a file system named Erfs. NodeDefs should be list defining
where to find the root directory for each node that should be a part
of this file system. NodeDefs has the format [{Node1, Root1}, {Node2,
Root2}, ... {NodeN, RootN}]. The root directories will be created and
should not exist prior to running this command. A directory named
.erfstemp will be created in the root directory as well. This
directory is used for file transfers and should not be removed or used
in any other way. The root directory of an ERFS is "/" (slash). Even
in the windows environment slash is used as the directory
delimiter. Access of files or directories in ERFS must be absolute.

- add_erfs(Erfs, NodeDef)
Add an erfs to a node. NodeDef is a tuple {Node, Root}, which
indicates where the rootdir for Erfs should be on the node, Node. Only
succeeds if nobody is manipulating Erfs. 

- delete_erfs(Erfs)
Delete a file system. Only succeeds if nobody is manipulating Erfs.

- delete_erfs(Erfs, Node)
Delete an erfs on a Node. Only succeeds if nobody is manipulating Erfs.

- check_out(Erfs, Path) 
Check out the file or directory Path. Path must be absolute. This will
only succeed if no one else has checked out anything in Path. If Path
is a directory, everything below it will be checked out, including
other directories. Once you have checked out a file or directory
manipulate them any way you want and then use check_in(Erfs, Path) to
replicated your changes to all other nodes. Nobody will be allowed to
check out or delete something that is checked out by somebody else.

- check_in(Erfs, Path)
Check in the file or directory Path. Path must be absolute. This will
only succeed if you have checked out Path prior to running this
command. The changes you have made in Path will be replicated to all
other nodes part of this particular ERFS.

- delete(Erfs, Path)
Delete Path from the ERFS Erfs.

- status(Erfs, Path)
Report the state of Path. Will return a list on the format [{State1,
[Path1, Path2, ... PathN]}, {State2, [Path1, Path2, ... PathN]}, ...]

- reset(Erfs, Path)
Will force the state of Path and it's contents to 'ok'. This function
exist because ERFS is still in beta.
